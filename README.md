# Banijay TV Show Ratings Forecasting Project

## Project Overview

As a student, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Banijay, a leading global content creator and distributor of television and multimedia programming. Banijay is known for producing a wide range of popular television shows and content. They approached me to help analyze their data and develop a ratings forecasting model for their shows based on various factors such as time, cast, season, and more.

This project involved the use of data analysis, data merging, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and data visualization techniques to gain insights and make predictions regarding show ratings.

## Project Notebooks

### 1. Merging Data (merging_data.ipynb)

In this Jupyter notebook, I merged large datasets containing information about Banijay's shows with another extensive dataset containing ratings for each show at specific times. This data merging process was crucial for subsequent analysis and forecasting.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA.ipynb)

The EDA notebook focused on exploring and understanding the merged dataset. It included data cleaning, visualization, and description to identify interesting patterns and gain a comprehensive understanding of the data. This step was essential in preparing the data for further analysis.

### 3. Twitter Data Merge (twitter_data_merge.ipynb)

In this notebook, I merged engagement rates calculated from scraped Twitter posts with the corresponding shows. Incorporating social media data can provide additional insights into audience engagement and its impact on show ratings.

### 4. Ratings Forecasting (ratings_forecasting.ipynb)

The ratings forecasting notebook involved the development of machine learning algorithms, including multiple linear regression and random forest, to forecast show ratings. These algorithms used various features such as cast, time, season, and more to make predictions.

## Tools Used

- Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
- Various Python libraries: Utilized a range of libraries for data manipulation, EDA, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Project Report

A comprehensive project report is available, which provides a detailed overview of the entire project. The report includes information about the reasons for the project, key findings, ethical considerations, data processing steps, and an overview of the machine learning lifecycle used for ratings forecasting.
